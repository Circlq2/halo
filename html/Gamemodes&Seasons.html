            <p>
                Academy is a mode where players can do whatever they want and use whatever gun in a single player environment. Tutorials are found here for beginners. Arena modes include oddball, slayer, capture the flag and strongholds. In oddball teams fight for control of a “ball‘ and points are scored based on how long a team can protect the ball. Slayer works just like a standard team deathmatch and the capture the flag gamemode is pretty simple. Strongholds is based around dominating 3 different zones and holding them from the enemy team to score points.

                More game modes include big team battle, this is a 12v12 rather than a 4v4 and includes much larger maps and vehicles compared to the standard arena mode. Game objectives are also bigger to balance the game but they are pretty similar to arena. Bot arena allows the user to select between big team battles and arenas but only include AI enemies, this is good for starting players. Fiesta is also a fun gamemode where all players spawn with random loadouts in a mix of arena modes, this isn’t available in BTB.
